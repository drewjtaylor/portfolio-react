        <h3>Welcome to my corner of the web!</h3>
        <p>Hello, I'm Andrew, and I'm passionate about building things to make life better. I started my journer as a developer when my parents bought me "Mario Teaches Typing." I didn't know it, but that fun little typing game planted a seed of familiarity with computers that would continue to grow.</p>
        <p>While moving up through the ranks working in an attorney's office, I began going through free coding curricula online as a hobby. Eventually I decided I wanted to seek more structured training and make a career out of it!</p>
        <p>In the past year, I completed the Nucamp Back-end and Front-end programs, and have been making projects on my own.</p>
        <p>One of the things that excites me the most about this field is the fact that there is always something to learn. It might seem daunting to some to have to constantly be improving and educating, but to me that sounds like the ideal way to live!</p>
        <p>Now I am looking for a junior developer position to kick-start my career and learn new skills.</p>
